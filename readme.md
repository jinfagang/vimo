**visual motion controller** is a controller which controls everything using a single camera. Nowadays we were really stucked by mouse and keyboard, it sometimes not convinient and cool. Think about we can control computer, television, phones by simply wave your hands in the air, that would be very much cool and powerful!

The structure of **vimo** is simply:

- `backend`: the backend using camera or radar detecting gestures, the out comes signals to frontend;
- `frontend`: frontend can be mission-aware, for example, you can control your computer by subscribe outcomes from backend.

The backend of **vimo** consist of several computer vision algorithms powered by Deep Learning which using hand detection and hand pose estimation.

We will do both hand detection and hand pose estimation as well as hand tracking. So that every movement of your hands will be captured.
