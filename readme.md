# vmo

**visual motion controller** is a controller which controls everything using a single camera. Nowadays we were really stucked by mouse and keyboard, it sometimes not convinient and cool. Think about we can control computer, television, phones by simply wave your hands in the air, that would be very much cool and powerful!

the roadmap of **vmo** is:

- AI powered gesture analysing, vmo will know what is your purpose;
- Controller APIs of Linux, Windows, macOS etc. Even some TV operation systems (mostly it is Android based.);
- Core tech of vmo is hand detection and gesture recognition, also hands finger points tracking.

**this project is under development and maybe close opensource at anytime**.
